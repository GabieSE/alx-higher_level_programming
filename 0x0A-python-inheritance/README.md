# 0x0A Python Inheritance

## Overview

This directory covers the concept of inheritance in Python, a fundamental aspect of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Inheritance allows classes to inherit properties and behaviors from other classes, facilitating code reuse and hierarchy.

## Key Topics Covered

- Understanding superclass and subclass relationships
- Inheriting attributes and methods
- Method overriding and attribute modification in subclasses
- Multiple inheritance and method resolution order (MRO)
- Polymorphism and its implementation with inheritance

## Files Included

1. `0-lookup.py`: Python script that returns a list of available attributes and methods of an object.
2. `1-my_list.py`: Implementation of a class `MyList` inheriting from `list` with added functionality.
3. `2-is_same_class.py`: Python function to check if an object is exactly an instance of a specified class.
4. `3-is_kind_of_class.py`: Python function to check if an object is an instance of a class or its subclasses.
5. `4-inherits_from.py`: Python function to check if an object inherits from a specified class.
6. `5-base_geometry.py`: Base class `BaseGeometry` representing basic geometry methods.
7. `6-rectangle.py`: Subclass `Rectangle` inheriting from `BaseGeometry` with area calculation methods.
8. `7-base_geometry.py`: Additional methods added to the `BaseGeometry` class.
9. `8-rectangle.py`: Subclass `Rectangle` with validation of width and height parameters.
10. `9-rectangle.py`: Final implementation of `Rectangle` class with string representation.

## How to Use

1. Each Python file can be executed directly to test its functionalities.
2. To use any class defined in these files, import the required class into your Python script or interpreter session.

## Additional Notes

- Inheritance in Python promotes code reusability, extensibility, and abstraction, enhancing the organization and structure of code in object-oriented programming.
- Understanding inheritance is crucial for building modular and scalable applications while leveraging the principles of OOP in Python.
